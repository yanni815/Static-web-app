        <h2>About this Website</h2>
        <p>
            This site was created to showcase a small gallery of anime characters that I enjoy personally.
            Each character includes a short summary and profile page so users can learn about their personality, ablilties, and role.
            I chose these characters because they are meaningful to me and represent different types of growth, teamwork, and individuality.
            The goal of the site is to give users a easy way to explore the characters while also demonstrating multi-page website design and navigation.
            The layout uses a card-style gallery for orginization and readability, with consistent navigation across all pages to make the site easy to use.
